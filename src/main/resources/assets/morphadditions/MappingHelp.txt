MapAbilities.json Tutorial
This is a short tutorial on the mappings and their format!
Each entity can have ONLY 1 trigger-able ability (AbilityAction). Similar to Morph, the mappings are laid out like so in the config:
	EXAMPLE:  'fullClassName': "'abilityName'|'minimumCooldown','maximumCooldown'|'arguments'

So here is the break down if that was not simple enough :P
First, is the full class name. This is the KEY for the mapping, as is shown in json file format.
EXAMPLE:"net.minecraft.entity.passive.EntityPig"
The value, then, is primarily the abilities mapped name. All inherent abilities can be found in the default generated file.
After the name, is the minimum and maximum cooldown times. ¡!IN TICKS!¡
The former (minimum) can have minimum value of 0, and the latter (maximum) can have a minimum value of 1. This would have the same effect as leaving out the two integers, as follows:
	EXAMPLE:  'fullClassName': "'abilityName'|'arguments'

Finally, make sure you LOOK AT THE DEFAULT MAPPINGS. Using this tutorialalong with the default mappings should provide you with a good understanding at how the config is setup. That said, here is a sample and breakdown:

"net.minecraft.entity.passive.EntityChicken": "drop|6000,12000|minecraft:egg:0"
This gives the mapping to the Minecraft Chicken entity. The ability is the AbilityDrop (mapped using its name "drop").
6000 is the minimum cooldown, which is 5 minutes, and 12000 is the maximum cooldown, being 10 minutes.
A random integer will be pulled between these two (6000-11999 ticks) and will be set as teh cooldown when you trigger the ability.
For this specific ability, the first arg is the item/block name (using the format: "modID:itemName:metadata").
For this ability, there are no other args.



The following are the args of all default abilities, as well as each's name.
Assume numerical numbers are integers unless specified.
name - args (separates by commas)
	drop - modid item mapping
	summon - class path for summon entity , number of entities to spawn , the radius around the player in which the entities will spawn
	explode - explosion radius (float)
	teleport - the maximum distance for player to locate (cursor position)(double)
	ejectLargeFireball - the maximum distance for player to locate (cursor position)(double) , explosion radius
	ejectSmallFireball - the maximum distance for player to locate (cursor position)(double)
	ejectSnowball - the maximum distance for player to locate (cursor position)(double)
